      <span class="inspiration-author">— Michael Mann</span>
      <p class="inspiration-description">Legendary movie. Perfect cinema. My favorite film of all time. Is it delusional to say I feel a deep kinship with De Niro? And yet somehow I might like Val Kilmer's character even more. If you are a man in your 20s you must absolutely must watch this. <br><br>"Don't let yourself get attached to anything you are not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you feel the heat around the corner." </p>

      <span class="inspiration-author">— Kiyoshi Kurosawa</span>
      <p class="inspiration-description">A detective investigating a string of murders becomes obsessed with the mysterious suspect. One of the most unsettling films I've ever watched. Shadow repression, hypnosis, Jung and Mesmer. Additionally, the characters' outfits are all fantastic. </p>

      <span class="inspiration-author">— Jean Baudrillard</span>
      <p class="inspiration-description">America, from the outside in. Baudrillard starts with the desert. I thoroughly agree. Driving the highway through the American West is like nothing else. "Speed is the triumph of effect over cause... The superficiality and reversibility of a pure object in the pure geometry of the desert." Many great one-liners in this book. <br> <br>"Money is fluid. Like grace, it is never yours. Coming to claim it is an offense against the divinity."</p>

      <span class="inspiration-author">— Osamu Dazai</span>
      <p class="inspiration-description">I was recommended this by a girl I once knew. Given the context of our situation I assume she meant it as an insult. After I read it, I took it as the greatest compliment. I've always wanted to be a tortured artist alienated from society. We don't speak anymore. I miss her sometimes. <br> <br>
      "...If you look carefully you will begin to feel that there is something strangely unpleasant about this handsome young man. I have never seen a young man whose good looks were so baffling."</p>

      <span class="inspiration-author">— Christopher Nolan</span>
      <p class="inspiration-description">I enjoyed this movie. Sue me. I love Robert Pattinson. Elizabeth Debicki is beautiful. The concept is utterly captivating. Nick Land-esque. A superintelligence reaching back through time to construct itself. Time travel as negentropy. Chris Nolan has glimpsed the Tree of Life. Yes, the execution could have been better. Still, I think this might be my favorite Nolan movie.</p>
