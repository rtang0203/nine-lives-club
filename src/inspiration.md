      <span class="inspiration-author">— Kiyoshi Kurosawa</span>
      <p class="inspiration-description">A detective investigating a string of murders becomes obsessed with the mysterious suspect. One of the most unsettling films I've ever watched. Explores repression of the shadow, hypnosis, Jung and Mesmer. Tangentially, the outfits of the characters are all fantastic. </p>

      <span class="inspiration-author">— Jean Baudrillard</span>
      <p class="inspiration-description">America, from the outside in. Baudrillard starts with the desert. I thoroughly agree with him on this-- driving the highway through the American West is like nothing else. "Speed is the triumph of effect over cause... The superficiality and reversibility of a pure object in the pure geometry of the desert." Many great one-liners in this book. <br>"Money is fluid. Like grace, it is never yours. Coming to claim it is an offense against the divinity."</p>

      <span class="inspiration-author">— Osamu Dazai</span>
      <p class="inspiration-description">I was recommended this by a girl I once knew. Given the context of our situation I have to assume she meant it as an insult, at least partially. After I read it, I took it as the greatest compliment. I've always wanted to be a tortured artist alienated from society. We don't speak anymore. I miss her sometimes. <br>
      "...If you look carefully you will begin to feel that there is something strangely unpleasant about this handsome young man. I have never seen a young man whose good looks were so baffling."</p>

      <span class="inspiration-author">— Christopher Nolan</span>
      <p class="inspiration-description">I enjoyed this movie. Sue me. I love Robert Pattinson. Elizabeth Debicki is beautiful. The concept is utterly captivating. Nick Land-esque. A superintelligence reaching back through time to construct itself. Time travel as negentropy. Chris Nolan has glimpsed the Tree of Life. Yes the execution could have been better but I think this might be my favorite Nolan movie.</p>
